Credit Card Fraud Detection Using LSTM & Attention Mechanism
Description: Developed a deep learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using LSTM-based architectures. Implemented a baseline LSTM, an optimized LSTM model, and an Attention-augmented LSTM model for enhanced accuracy.

Key Contributions:

Preprocessed the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset and normalized features for optimal model performance.

Built a Baseline LSTM model to establish benchmark results.

Designed a Modified LSTM model with Bidirectional LSTMs, Batch Normalization, Spatial Dropout, and AdamW optimizer to improve accuracy.

Developed an Attention-enhanced LSTM model, integrating a custom Attention layer to capture long-range dependencies.

Evaluated models based on Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC, achieving a significant performance boost with the Attention-LSTM model.

Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, LSTM, Attention Mechanism, AdamW, StandardScaler, Matplotlib, Seaborn
